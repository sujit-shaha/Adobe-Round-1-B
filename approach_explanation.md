# Persona Document Intelligence

## Approach and Architecture

This document explains the architecture and approach of the Persona Document Intelligence tool, designed to extract, analyze, and summarize information from PDF documents.

### Architecture Overview

The system consists of several key components:

1. **PDF Parser**: Extracts text, metadata, and optionally images from PDF documents
2. **Embeddings Generator**: Creates vector embeddings for document content to enable semantic search
3. **Summarizer**: Generates concise summaries of document content
4. **Ranker** (future implementation): Re-ranks search results based on relevance using cross-encoder models

### Processing Pipeline

The processing pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Document Ingestion**: PDFs are loaded and parsed to extract text and metadata.
2. **Text Chunking**: Extracted text is divided into manageable chunks with overlaps to preserve context.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Each text chunk is converted into a vector embedding using a pretrained model.
4. **Indexing**: Embeddings are stored for efficient retrieval and searching.
5. **Summarization**: Key information is summarized for quick review.

### Search and Retrieval

When querying the system:

1. The query is converted to an embedding using the same model used for documents.
2. Similar document chunks are retrieved based on embedding similarity (cosine similarity).
3. (Optional) Results can be re-ranked using a cross-encoder model for better relevance.
4. The most relevant chunks are returned as results.

### Technology Stack

- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers, Transformers, PyTorch
- **Summarization**: Transformers with BART or similar model
- **Storage**: JSON files (can be extended to vector databases)
- **User Interface**: Command Line Interface with interactive mode

### Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible:

- New document types can be supported by adding appropriate parser modules.
- Different embedding and summarization models can be easily swapped in.
- The storage layer can be replaced with a vector database for scaling to larger document collections.
- A REST API could be added to serve results to web applications.

### Performance Considerations

- Embedding models are cached in the models directory for offline use.
- Processing large documents is done in chunks to manage memory usage.
- The application can be containerized for consistent deployment environments.

### Future Enhancements

1. Integration with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
2. Web interface for easier interaction
3. Document comparison features
4. Multi-language support
5. Support for additional document formats (DOCX, HTML, etc.)
