The \ufb01eld now involves\nmolecular, biological, and immunological disciplines.\nAmong the core authors published in this \ufb01eld, the team\nrepresented by Zheng Mingyue and Jiang Hualing had close\ncollaboration and a large network layout, both of whom belong\nto\nthe\nInstitute\nof\nthe\nShanghai\nInstitute\nfor\nAdvanced\nImmunochemical Studies (SIAIS), and they had more outputs\nand maintained a high scienti\ufb01c impact during 2020\u20132023. The\nmost-cited paper by the team was published in 2020.

Simultaneously, GNN\nautomatically learns the representation of molecules through graph\nembedding and integrates multi-modal data, which has obvious\nadvantages in understanding the multilevel mechanism of drug\naction and improving prediction accuracy (Xiong et al., 2020; Zhou\net al., 2020). GNN can be trained to predict multiple target tasks at the\nsame time, such as predicting the solubility and toxicity of molecules at\nthe same time. This approach eliminates the need for traditional\nmachine learning algorithms to create separate models for each\nprediction task and overcomes the challenge of enabling knowledge\nsharing among multiple independent models (Stokes et al., 2020). While\nGNN has obvious advantages in drug discovery, it also presents\nchallenges such as the insuf\ufb01cient interpretability of the model, the\nneed for large amounts of labeled data for training, and the high\nconsumption of computing resources (Zhou et al., 2020; Wu et al.,\n2021a). Therefore, scientists are constantly exploring and improving\nGNN, and the output of related research results has been increasing.\nHowever, it is dif\ufb01cult for researchers to grasp the latest progress and\nresearch hotspots in the \ufb01eld from numerous research results. Hence,\nsummarizing the development status and research hotspots is crucial for\nestablishing research directions and guiding future research.
